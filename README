WRITING YOUR OWN FILTER

This package includes a Image::Filter::Foo module, which can be used as 
template for your own filter. Consult the gd documentation on how to use 
specific pixel based routines. Currently, the package only includes Black & 
White filters (this should change in the future). Did I mention this module
is work under development?
